Notes for week 6, session 1

Use States, 

To reduce rendering we have used the method to push down the state,
use itlike a tree if you have a component that has a lot of children
and you want to pass the state down

// Topic 
React.memo 
This is a higher order component that will only re-render if the props change.

//Topic 
Keys in react 

Keys help react identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
 Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.
When you don't specify a key, React will use the array index as the key by default.
However, this can lead to issues when the order of items changes, as React may not correctly 
identify which items have been modified.

//Topic
.map()  function
The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every
element in the calling array.

//Topic 
Wrapper Component = A wrapper component is a component that wraps around other components to provide additional functionality or styling.
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CardWrapper>Hi There</CardWrapper>
    </div>
  );
}

function CardWrapper({ children }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: "2px solid white ", padding: 20 }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
